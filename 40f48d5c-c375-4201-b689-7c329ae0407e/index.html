Breath is the bridge between the body and the mind. Regulate breath, and the body and mind will follow.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/682ace72-70a3-4d00-9812-c5e92ffc6243.gif"><p><b>Remember to build the foundation</b></p><p>First, you establish the basics of breathing. If you will quickly scan the topics listed in this section, immediately below, you will see that they are not so much breathing techniques as they are methods of establishing basic breath awareness and elimination of irregularities. With breath training, one of the biggest mistakes is to skip the foundation, and go directly into the techniques themselves.</p><p>The science of breath begins and ends with awareness...</p><p>Breath awareness is so important that, in a sense, you can say that the whole science of breath begins with awareness, and ends with awareness. Everything else, in the middle, is preparation for awareness.</p><p><b>The finest bridge between body and mind:</b></p><p>Breath is a bridge between the body and the mind. When trying to meditate it is extremely common to have tension in the muscles and noisy thoughts in the mind. The nervous system is the arbiter between the tense body and the noisy mind. One of the best ways to regulate that nervous system, and in turn the body and mind, is through the breath. This has been known by the Yogis for thousands of years, and has also come to be widely known in recent years by the modern medical and psychological community.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a147ae00-1ff4-44c4-89c0-ef20b24ce611.jpg"><p><b>Value of Soham and breath:</b></p><p>One of the finest, easiest, and most direct ways to train the breath, and in turn, regulate the nervous system, relax the body, and quiet the mind is through Soham mantra practiced at a steady, slow speed, with exhalation somewhat longer in duration than the inhalation.</p><p>A CD of the same practise will be coming soon!</p><p><b>Have an attitude of curiosity</b></p><p>The entire science of breath begins with awareness of what the breath is doing. To do this means to have an attitude of being an explorer, an interior researcher. It means cultivating an attitude of curiosity that allows you to wander around inside of yourself noticing the way in which breath operates.</p><p>It's like the way a child might take apart a toy to see how it works, only in this case nothing is being taken apart. You are just being still, closing your eyes and snooping around the entire breathing apparatus, whether the gross body, or subtler aspects.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/79b87a08-183d-4c52-901a-2bbcfce70541.jpg"><p>Awareness of the feel of the breath at the bridge of the nostrils is a very simple, straightforward, and highly effective meditation practice. It is the cognitive sense of touch, as the air is literally felt to come and go. To allow the breath to slow on exhalation is a further refinement, whereby exhalation is as much as twice the duration as inhalation. For even finer experience, allow there to be no pause between the breaths, with exhalation gently flowing into inhalation, and inhalation gently flowing into exhalation. This is excellent preparation for the subtler, more advanced practices.</p><p>Diaphragmatic breathing </p><p>The diaphragm is a huge muscle that rests horizontally across the base of the rib cage. Imagine an oval shaped dinner plate, turned upside down, and inside your lower rib cage. The diaphragm is connected in the front, along the sides of your lower ribs, and also along the back.</p><p>Diaphragmatic breathing is one of the most important foundation practices for meditation.</p><p>When the diaphragm is used for breathing, there is little motion in the lower abdomen, and the chest remains still. However, we lead stress-filled lives, and learn bad breathing habits, using the abdomen and the chest. This creates further tension that leaves us in a vicious cycle of mental chatter driving bad breathing and physical tightness, and the bad breathing, in turn, causing trouble to the mind.</p><p>It is important to note that modern medicine has finally acknowledged what the yogis have known for thousands of years, that the breath is intimately connected to the autonomic nervous system and the mind. Even some hospitals and medical establishments are now willing to train people in breath regulation.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
